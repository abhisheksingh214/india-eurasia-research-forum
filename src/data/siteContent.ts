While the extended neighbourhood approach towards West Asia and East Asia was relatively successful, registering significant growth in terms of trade and investments in the last decade, Central Asia continues to lie on the outskirts of India\u2019s Extended Neighbourhood despite tall claims. The latest developments in the region, such as India\u2019s exit from the Ayni Airbase in Tajikistan last year, and more significantly, its decision to pull out of the Chabahar port project following the expiring <a href=\"https://theprint.in/diplomacy/in-a-relief-for-india-trump-2-0-extends-sanctions-waiver-for-chabahar-port-operations/2773619/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-[#1B3B5F] hover:underline font-bold\">US sanctions' exemption</a> will diminish India\u2019s presence in Central Asia.

The region\u2019s significance was further supported by South Asia\u2019s historical linkages with Central Asia, as for several centuries, the Silk Road was the conduit of Eurasian continental trade and the site of hybridisation of cultures across Eurasia.

Following years of negotiations over funding, customs regulations, and other operational bottlenecks, India soon realised the importance of Iran in connecting with Central Asia and Afghanistan.

The port\u2019s regional profile rose when India signed the Ashgabat Agreement in 2018, and in 2021, <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-proposes-inclusion-of-irans-chabahar-port-in-international-north-south-transport-corridor/articleshow/81336893.cms?from=mdr\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-[#1B3B5F] hover:underline font-bold\">proposed Chabahar\u2019s integration in INSTC</a>, projecting Indian influence in the region for the first time. India endorsed the port\u2019s regional utility by successfully lobbying the US government to exempt Chabahar from sanctions. In May 2024, India\u2019s Indian Ports Global Limited (IPGL) <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-signs-10-year-contract-to-operate-chabahar-port-in-iran/article68170845.ece\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-[#1B3B5F] hover:underline font-bold\">signed a ten-year contract</a> with Iran\u2019s Port and Maritime Organisation (PMO) to develop the Shahid-Beheshti terminal of Chabahar port, committing $120 million for developing the port and offering a $250 million line of credit for expanding Chabahar-related regional infrastructure.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-[#1B3B5F] mt-8 mb-4\">India\u2019s ad hoc approach to Central Asia</h3><p>Evidentially, Chabahar became the lodestar of India\u2019s connectivity push with Central Asia in the last decade. It was also projected as India\u2019s only viable land-link with Afghanistan, delivering over <a href=\"https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/34857/Humanitarian_Assistance_to_Afghanistan\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-[#1B3B5F] hover:underline font-bold\">2.5 million tons of wheat and humanitarian aid</a> during the Covid-19 pandemic to the embattled country. India\u2019s bilateral trade with Central Asian republics also doubled in the last decade, partly due to Chabahar\u2019s operationalalisation and due to strengthening of the institutional framework of relations through dialogue and summit-level frameworks in 2019 and 2022. Modest growth in India-Central Asia trade notwithstanding, the quantum of trade still remains much less than that of Russia, China and Turkey\u2019s trade with the region. Nevertheless, India\u2019s excellent relations with Iran and Central Asia made Chabahar <a href=\"https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-chabahar-gambit-india-s-play-for-influence-in-central-asia\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-[#1B3B5F] hover:underline font-bold\">a successful example of India\u2019s regional diplomacy</a> in an otherwise complex region, giving landlocked Central Asian countries access to the Indian Ocean.</p><h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-[#1B3B5F] mt-8 mb-4\">US sanctions on Iran and India\u2019s Strategic Retreat from Central Asia</h3><p>India\u2019s optimism over its foreign policy posturing of strategic autonomy, however, turned to be short lived in the wake of the US President\u2019s twenty-five percent tariffs threat to countries doing trade with Iran early this year. Facing rising US pressure, India had already been reducing oil and gas imports from Iran, with <a href=\"https://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/exports/iran\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-[#1B3B5F] hover:underline font-bold\">bilateral trade going down</a> from $17 billion in 2018-2019 to $1.68 billion in 2024-2025, but the latest US threat comes as a significant setback. The <a href=\"https://infra.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/ports-shipping/indias-strategic-withdrawal-from-chabahar-port-as-us-sanctions-loom/126541523\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-[#1B3B5F] hover:underline font-bold\">Economic Times reported early this year</a> that following US\u2019 sanctions exemption expiring in September last year, India had begun winding up operations at Chabahar, transferring the remaining financial commitment to Iran and exiting from operations at the port.</p><p>This news comes at the backdrop of another revelation in October last year that <a href=\"https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/india-exit-ayni-airbase-tajikistan-russia-china\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-[#1B3B5F] hover:underline font-bold\">India had exited the Ayni Airbase</a>, a small functional airbase on the outskirt of the Tajik capital of Dushanbe, which India refurbished in the early 2000s and used as a listening post near the Tajik-Afghan border. The exit from Ayni Airbase last year was still seen as a symbolic loss. However, the winding up of Indian operations at Chabahar, a project in which India has <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-has-invested-nearly-500-million-in-chabahar-port-jaishankar/article68172931.ece\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-[#1B3B5F] hover:underline font-bold\">invested close to half a billion dollars</a> and extensive diplomatic capital, will have lasting repercussions.</p><p>On a bilateral level, India\u2019s already strained trade ties with Iran comes in the backdrop of the rapidly evolving situation in West Asia. As the US-Israeli attack on Iran unfolds, reports suggest aerial <a href=\"https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/damage-around-port-city-chabahar-iran-israel-strike-india-terminal\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-[#1B3B5F] hover:underline font-bold\">damage around the port city of Chabahar</a>, even though there is <a href=\"https://m.thewire.in/article/diplomacy/no-damage-reported-at-the-india-operated-shahid-beheshti-terminal\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-[#1B3B5F] hover:underline font-bold\">no damage reported at the India operated Shahid Beheshti terminal</a>. However, the Israeli-US strikes on Iran\u2019s critical infrastructure will complicate India\u2019s limited operational role in the port, and discourage private investment in the future. In a region which India considers its extended neighbourhood, stepping down from Chabahar without an alternative will undermine India\u2019s already limited engagement with Central Asia. On the other hand, it will strengthen Pakistan\u2019s credibility to the Central Asian republics for accessing the Indian ocean through Chinese-led BRI infrastructure. In the wider region, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/3146467/india-central-asia-outreach-under-threat-taliban-takeover\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-[#1B3B5F] hover:underline font-bold\">ceding space to China</a> and Pakistan will erode India\u2019s long-term presence in Eurasia.",

For me, the journey was more than a diplomatic event or an international conference. It was a deeply meaningful opportunity to experience a country that has long maintained historical, cultural, and intellectual ties with Central Asia.</p><p>As someone who grew up in Kazakhstan and now teaches chemistry at the Nazarbayev Intellectual School in Turkestan, I have always been interested in how countries collaborate through education, science, and youth engagement. The forum offered exactly that: a platform where young professionals from Central Asia could exchange ideas with Indian counterparts about regional cooperation, innovation, and cultural understanding.</p><p>From the moment I arrived, India left a strong impression on me. The scale, diversity, and energy of the country was remarkable. Cities moved at an intense rhythm, yet there was also a sense of openness and curiosity among the people I met. India felt both ancient and modern at the same time \u2013 a place where centuries-old traditions coexist with technological innovation and ambitious economic development.</p><div class=\"my-8\"><img src=\"/images/publications/nur-reception.jpg\" class=\"w-full rounded-xl shadow-lg border border-gray-100 object-cover\" alt=\"Traditional Indian Reception\" /><p class=\"text-xs text-center text-gray-500 mt-2 font-medium\">A traditional Indian reception for the Central Asian Youth Delegation, March, 2025</p></div><p>The Youth Forum itself was organised at a very high level by New Delhi. The program included discussions with policymakers, scholars, and young leaders who shared perspectives on regional cooperation between India and Central Asia. These conversations highlighted the strategic importance of strengthening people-to-people connections and building cross-cultural connections. While governments can establish diplomatic frameworks, it is often students, researchers, and young professionals who build the real bridges between societies.</p><p>One of the most memorable aspects of the visit was interacting with fellow participants from different countries. Delegates from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan had the opportunity to share their views on regional development and cultural exchange. At the same time, Indian participants introduced us to the intellectual and cultural diversity of their country. These conversations were not limited to formal sessions. Some of the most valuable exchanges happened during informal discussions, shared meals, and cultural visits.</p><p>India\u2019s cultural richness also left a lasting impression on me. Walking through historical landmarks and observing daily life offered insights that no book or lecture could fully convey. The architecture, art, and traditions reflected a long and complex history that has shaped the identity of the country. At the same time, I was struck by how strongly young Indians are engaging with global issues such as technology, entrepreneurship, and sustainable development.</p><p>Another aspect that impressed me was India\u2019s commitment to education and knowledge exchange. As an educator myself, I was particularly interested in how universities, research institutions, and policy think tanks collaborate to support innovation and international dialogue. The forum demonstrated that India sees education and youth engagement as important tools of public diplomacy and regional cooperation.</p><div class=\"my-8\"><img src=\"/images/publications/nur-iit.jpg\" class=\"w-full rounded-xl shadow-lg border border-gray-100 object-cover\" alt=\"At IIT Delhi\" /><p class=\"text-xs text-center text-gray-500 mt-2 font-medium\">At the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India</p></div><p>For me, the visit also reinforced the historical connections between Central Asia and India, which are more than a millennium old. For centuries, trade routes, cultural exchange, and intellectual interaction linked the two regions. Today, these connections continue in new forms through academic partnerships, cultural initiatives, and youth forums such as the one I attended. It was inspiring to see how modern diplomacy is built upon these historical ties.</p><p>One of my main takeaways from the experience is the importance of dialogue and mutual understanding. When people from different countries meet and share their perspectives, stereotypes disappear, and genuine partnerships can emerge. International cooperation becomes more meaningful when it is supported by personal relationships and cultural awareness.</p><p>As a teacher, this experience also influenced how I think about education. I realised that preparing students for the future requires more than strong academic knowledge. It also requires global awareness, cultural openness, and the ability to collaborate with people from different backgrounds. Experiences like the India \u2013 Central Asia Youth Forum demonstrate the value of international engagement in shaping the next generation of leaders.</p><div class=\"my-8\"><img src=\"/images/publications/nur-meeting.jpg\" class=\"w-full rounded-xl shadow-lg border border-gray-100 object-cover\" alt=\"Meeting with leaders\" /><p class=\"text-xs text-center text-gray-500 mt-2 font-medium\">From a meeting with educationists and industry leaders</p></div><p>When I returned to Kazakhstan, I shared my experiences with colleagues and students. Many of them were curious to learn more about India \u2013 its culture, society, and opportunities for collaboration. This exchange of stories and perspectives is exactly how international understanding grows: through individual experiences that inspire broader curiosity and dialogue.</p><p>Looking back, my visit to India was not only a professional opportunity but also a personal journey of discovery. It allowed me to see a country that is vibrant, diverse, and forward-looking. More importantly, it reminded me that meaningful cooperation between regions begins with human connections.</p><p>Initiatives such as the India \u2013 Central Asia Youth Forum play an important role in strengthening these connections. By bringing together young people from different societies, they help build the foundations for long-term cooperation and goodwill.</p><p>I hope that exchanges between India and Central Asia will continue to grow in the coming years. The potential for collaboration in education, science, culture, and innovation is enormous. For young professionals like me, participating in such initiatives is both a privilege and a responsibility \u2013 to carry forward the spirit of dialogue and partnership that these forums represents.</p>",

      "content": "<i>A view of the Rashtrapati Bhawan, New Delhi, India</i><p>Globally, Eurasia refers to the world's largest continuous landmass, combining Europe and Asia as a single supercontinent. The term originated in the 19th century as a geographical construct. Later, it was popularised by political geographers to describe the combined Europe-Asia landmass without artificial divisions like the Ural Mountains. In geopolitical discourse, it gained prominence through Halford Mackinder's Heartland theory in the early 20th century. Mackinder\u2019s Heartland theory suggested that control of the Eurasian core (especially Central Asia) is pivotal to global dominance. In the post-Soviet era, this geopolitical reading of Eurasia has evolved. Russian thinkers like Alexander Dugin advocated it as Eurasianism and have framed it as a unique civilizational space blending Slavic, Turkic, and steppe elements.</p><p>Because of the geostrategic location and abundance of natural resources, Eurasia has long been a playground for major power play in the twenty-first century. For each major power engaged in Eurasia, distinct conceptions of the construct reflect their geopolitical interests. Russia\u2019s conception of \u2018Sphere of Influence\u2019 and resisting Western dominance in its backyard is one of its main geopolitical objectives in Eurasia. For China, the region is important for both economic and security interests. For the US and the West, Eurasia is seen as a theatre for containing Russia and China, the heartland\u2019s dominant powers. While all such distinct national conceptions of Eurasia treat Central Asia as the locus region, the term itself has become a \u2018definitional morass\u2019, evading strict definitions or geographical strictures.</p><p>For India, Eurasia is not merely geographical but a civilizational and strategic continuum rooted in ancient linkages spanning across millennia. Much before the Silk Road, the Indian subcontinent, or South Asia today, frequently exchanged ideas, commodities, peoples and philosophies with this region. In the twenty-first century, it represents India's extended neighbourhood beyond the maritime domain, encompassing energy-rich Central Asia, the Caspian Sea linked-Caucasus region, and Russia. Afghanistan also occupies a pivotal place in India\u2019s conception of Eurasia as it serves as an interface between Central and South Asia, and is sometimes treated simultaneously as part of India\u2019s immediate and extended neighbourhoods.</p><p>Unlike the Western view of Eurasia as a heartland prize or Russian civilizational narrative, India's conception of Eurasia emphasises mutual respect for sovereignty, multipolarity, and balanced partnerships. The region itself is vital for India's energy security - oil, gas, uranium and critical minerals. The forces of extremism and radicalisation in the region, especially in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, makes the area of strategic interest to India. As a result, India has promoted counter-terrorism cooperation with Afghanistan and the Central Asian republic. Another major driving force in India\u2019s Eurasia calculus include the imperative of trade diversification with this underexplored region, and to prevent its encirclement by any single power.</p><p>New Delhi's potential focus on the Eurasian region is also driven by its historical and cultural ties to Eurasian countries, especially Russia and the Central Asian Republics. For India\u2019s Eurasia strategy, Central Asia serves as the core, Afghanistan as a gateway, the South Caucasus as a strategic partner for shared interests in regional connectivity, and Russia as a reliable partner. India rejects zero-sum games and aspires to forge strategic partnerships and alliances with countries with common interests in regional stability, economic development, and multilateral cooperation. India's view avoids ideological framing, focusing on developmental partnerships and is rooted in the principle of strategic autonomy.</p><p>New Delhi continues to describe the region as part of its \u2018extended neighbourhood\u2019 and a \u2018natural partner.\u2019 Yet, this narrative has not translated into tangible strategic or economic gains. The Eurasian region presents immense economic opportunities for India. By leveraging its historical connections with the region, India aims to foster stronger people-to-people relations, promote tourism, and enhance cultural diplomacy. Rich in natural resources and strategically located along key trade routes, the region offers the potential for enhanced trade, investment, and energy cooperation.</p><p>India can tap into these markets, diversify its economic engagements, and strengthen its energy security. India's engagement with Eurasia is also crucial for maintaining a balance of power in the region as it seeks to promote a multipolar Eurasian order as a precursor to a just multipolar world. Unlike China and Russia's increasing assertiveness in Eurasia through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), India however, lacks strong institutional grounding or a regional grouping of its own through which it can actively participate in safeguarding its interests and counterbalance regional imbalances.</p><p>In the contemporary era, India's foreign policy has leaned towards the maritime domain (Indo-Pacific, Act East, Quad). On closer enquiry, this is partly due to the colonial legacy of the partition of South Asia in 1947 and the subsequent Pakistani refusal to allow India passage to Afghanistan and Central Asia. These structural constraints have led to relative Indian neglect of continental Eurasia in the last seven decades, despite enduring civilizational ties and several material linkages predating the partition of the subcontinent. India\u2019s \u2018Connect Central Asia\u2019 policy in 2012 marked a shift, but implementation lagged amid maritime priorities and continuing instability in Afghanistan.</p><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to all the five Central Asian countries in 2015 signalled a high point in India\u2019s regional outreach. However, high-level exchanges have since remained limited; the last state visit to India by a Central Asian leader was of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in 2018. Even though India-Central Asia relations matured in the last decade, beginning with the institutionalisation of dialogue at the foreign ministers\u2019 level in 2019, the first India\u2013Central Asia Summit convened virtually in 2022, and the SCO Summit under India\u2019s presidency held in a virtual format in 2023, the absence of sustained, in-person high-level engagements has contributed to a perception that India\u2019s engagement with Central Asia has lost momentum.</p><p>Broader geopolitical developments, including the fallout of the Russian-Ukrainian war, tensions in West Asia centring Iran, and shifting Eurasian connectivity dynamics, are reshaping the strategic calculations of the regional countries in Eurasia. Regional states are increasingly pursuing multi-vector foreign policies while expanding their engagement with a wide range of external partners. These developments, while presenting a complex geopolitical situation, are opening a sliver of opportunity for India. The country is well-placed as a neutral balancer with strong and resilient ties with Russia and Central Asian countries.</p><p>However, limited connectivity and the gap between policy formulation and implementation continue to hinder India\u2019s Eurasia strategy. To bridge this gap, India must adopt a consolidated, multi-pronged continental strategy prioritising alternative connectivity; including exploring air and digital connectivity. Leveraging soft power, including expanding educational cooperation, promoting cultural connections, bolstering people-to-people contacts and capacity-building programmes must be given high priority. In the absence of direct connectivity, incentivised investments (especially by private sector and through global arms of Indian public sector undertakings), localisation of bilateral economic activities, and digital cooperation have huge potential to grow.</p><p>Integrating Eurasia into India's broader grand strategy by balancing its maritime and continental dimensions is essential for sustained, meaningful engagement in the region. Despite geopolitical, logistical, and infrastructural barriers, New Delhi can steadily expand its influence through consensual partnerships that prioritize mutual respect for sovereignty and shared prosperity. Reclaiming India\u2019s continental thinking in terms of foreign and defence policy does not necessarily mean undermining its maritime priorities. It only needs a thorough, interest-based reassessment of India\u2019s strategic alignments through a bold engagement with the region and an ability to think beyond the obvious.</p><p>Against this evolving backdrop, the India Eurasia Research Forum (IERF) stands uniquely positioned to bridge persistent gaps and accelerate sustained, high-impact engagement between India and Eurasian stakeholders. As a dedicated platform focused exclusively on India-Eurasia ties, unlike broader think tanks with diversified mandates, IERF delivers targeted, high-quality research and facilitates multi-stakeholder dialogues. It convenes Track 1.5 and Track 2 initiatives that bring together government officials, domain experts, civil society, academia, and private-sector actors to address priority domains. This will include Physical and digital connectivity (including INSTC optimization, Chabahar synergies, air/digital corridors, and emerging tech linkages), security and counter-terrorism cooperation, energy security and critical minerals, cultural and people-to-people ties (education, tourism, capacity-building, and heritage diplomacy) and multipolarity and balanced regional dynamics.</p><p>Through regular seminars, webinars, policy roundtables, and Track 1.5 exchanges, IERF will generate actionable outputs such as commentaries, policy briefs, articles, joint research publications, and facilitate bilateral/multilateral exchanges. These efforts amplify India's strategic voice in Eurasian discourse while ensuring reciprocal insights flow back to New Delhi. This will help foster mutual understanding and consensus-driven partnerships.</p><p>In a rapidly transforming Eurasia, marked by multi-vector foreign policies and connectivity realignments, IERF will serve as a vital enabler. By driving evidence-based continental re-engagement, it will help India build enduring strategic depth that complements its continental priorities, safeguarding national interests through sovereignty-respecting cooperation and shared prosperity.",
